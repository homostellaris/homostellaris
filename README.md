# Personality

I am an _intuitive empath_. My Myers-Briggs personality type is _ENFP_. The sixteen personalities website says that I'm a _turbulent campaigner_ but that make me sound a bit mad üò¨ _Intuitive empath_ sounds cooler üòé

# Principles

For whatever mysterious reasons I hold the following virtues in greatest esteem and aspire to them.

**Honesty, integrity, tolerance, reason, humility, compassion.**

I love rule 5 from **7 Habits Of Highly Effective People** by Stephen R. Covey <sub>I recommend [the audiobook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary/dp/1511317302/ref=tmm_abk_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) read by the author.</sub>

> Seek first to understand, then to be understood.

The principle of [most respectful interpretation](https://fs.blog/most-respectful-interpretation/) is very important to me.

# Dream

I am a dreamer, and I long for a future in which technology has given humanity the freedom to thrive amongst the stars üåü

Such freedom would include the ability to safely travel anywhere allowed by the laws of physics as well as the autonomy to choose a craft according to one's own unique temperament and abilities without being constrained by lack of opportunity or misfortune. I believe that humanity's potential in such a future is far greater than we can imagine.

# Mission

As well as my own dreams, I am motivated by the dreams of others.

I am a passionate advocate of [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/). It provides a guiding framework for my endeavours and I would like it to do the same for others. I'm particulary interested in Longtermism.

As a 'longtermist' I also subscribe to the idea that humanity must become multiplanetary to ensure its surival. We must entertain the possiblity that we are the only intelligent species ever to have existed and if so that imparts upon us a moral duty to preserve the light of consciousness; we may be the only ones able to seed the universe with life. In other words, we may be the de facto stewards of life in the universe.

The difference between a universe brimming with life and one that is dead is almost impossible to comprehend so I take this mission very seriously and would like more people to do the same.

With all this in mind, my mission is to:

> Improve the probability that humanity becomes multiplanetary

It may be that the best way for me to do this is to [promote Effective Altruism](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/) and dreams of becoming a multiplanetary species to others who are better able to move the needle on this probability than I am üöÄ

# Hobbies & interests

I agree with Richard Feynman‚Äôs sentiment that ‚Äúanything is interesting if you go into it deeply enough‚Äù. However I spend most of my free time:

- Parenting!
- Hacking on hobby projects
- Playing guitar
- Playing & watching StarCraft 2 (a video game and e-sport)
- Bouldering (indoor climbing)

I‚Äôm particuarly interested in Artificial Intelligence, Astrophysics, Astrobiology, Effective Altruism (particularly Longtermism), and Space Colonisation. I also enjoy creating and debating _absurd hypotheticals_.
