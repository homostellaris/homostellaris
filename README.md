# Profession

I'm a software product creator who aspires to build things that are both useful and beautiful.

You can checkout my pinned repositories to see my work but here are a few quick links.

# Personality

I am an _intuitive empath_. My Myers-Briggs personality type is _ENFP_. The sixteen personalities website says that I'm a [_turbulent campaigner_](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality) but that make me sound a bit mad üò¨ _Intuitive empath_ sounds cooler üòé

# Principles

I don't think we talk about virtues enough anymore. Here are the ones that I aspire to the most.

**Honesty, integrity, tolerance, reason, humility, compassion.**

I love **7 Habits Of Highly Effective People** by Stephen R. Covey <sub>I recommend [the audiobook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Anniversary/dp/1511317302/ref=tmm_abk_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) read by the author.</sub>.

I particularly like habit 5.

> Seek first to understand, then to be understood.

The principle of [most respectful interpretation](https://fs.blog/most-respectful-interpretation/) is very important to me.

# Dream

I am a dreamer, and I long for a future in which technology has given humanity the freedom to thrive amongst the stars üåü

Such freedom would include the ability to safely travel anywhere allowed by the laws of physics as well as the autonomy to choose a purpose according to one's own unique temperament and abilities without being constrained by lack of opportunity or misfortune.

I believe that humanity's potential in such a future is far greater than we can imagine.

# Mission

My mission is one that is shared by many others.

> Improve the probability that humanity becomes multiplanetary

It took a lot of thought before I decided on this mission (and I may change it in future) so allow me provide some more context.

I am a passionate advocate of [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/). It provides a guiding framework for my endeavours and I would like it to do the same for others. I'm particulary interested in **Longtermism** which considers the lives of those who _may_ exist in the future to be of similar or equivalent value compared with the lives of those who already exist. There is [a great Kurzegstat video on YouTube about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEENEFaVUzU).

One possibility that I find extremely relevant in this context is that we are the only intelligent species every to have existed. Many consider this unlikely but it is not something we can rule out. We must hedge against this possibility because if it is the case we have a moral duty to preserve the life itself (or the 'light of consciousness' as some have framed it). We may be the only species capable of ensuring the continued existence of all other species. In other words, we may be the de facto stewards of life in the universe.

The difference between a universe brimming with life and one that is dead is almost impossible to comprehend so I take this mission very seriously and would like more people to do the same.

As a software engineer there are limts to have much I can contribute to this mission directly. It may be that the best way for me to do this is to [promote Effective Altruism](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/) and dreams of becoming a multiplanetary species to others who are better able to move the needle on this probability than I am üöÄ

# Hobbies & interests

I agree with Richard Feynman‚Äôs sentiment that ‚Äúanything is interesting if you go into it deeply enough‚Äù. However I spend most of my free time:

- Parenting!
- Hacking on hobby projects
- Playing guitar
- Playing & watching StarCraft 2 (a video game and e-sport)
- Bouldering (indoor climbing)

Some topics of particular interest to me are Artificial Intelligence, Astrophysics, Astrobiology, Effective Altruism (particularly Longtermism), and Space Colonisation. I also enjoy creating and debating _absurd hypotheticals_.
